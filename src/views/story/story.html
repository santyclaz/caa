					<p>“How do you say your name again?” was the first question Andrew asked Charlene. The two from different coasts met across the world in Beijing to study Mandarin one summer.</p>
					<p>He called her the “exotic fruits girl” because she was always eating strange fruits like ‘dragon fruit’. She knew him as the “notecards guy”, who sat in front of her in class and was always jotting down vocabulary on notecards.</p>
					<p>They only became friends when Charlene was in need of a study buddy. Andrew seemed like the perfect candidate. Little did she know, he would fall asleep on numerous occasions while studying. She was clearly deceived by those stack of notecards.</p>

					<p>The program ended after a two week travelling portion all over China - where Andrew and Charlene got to know one another more. Alas, they eventually had to part ways: one to sunny California, and the other to snowy cold Massachusetts. They did not think they would ever meet again.</p>

					<p>One morning, Charlene received an email, surprisingly from Andrew. It was the start of very long email chains filled with stories, jokes and pure silliness.</p>

					<p>Charlene visited Andrew in California and they officially became a couple. Andrew had every intention of asking her out the moment it was the New Year, but he missed it by 10 mins because he was struggling with the wine bottle (he has since learned how to use a bottle opener correctly). And it was the beginning of their long distance relationship.</p>

					<p>Andrew visited Charlene in Boston for spring break. When he first arrived, he was expecting a heartfelt reunion, but instead what he got was a nervous wreck of a woman, avoiding eye contact with him and talking too much.</p>

					<p>Charlene finally graduated from BU and was eagerly anticipating her visit to see Andrew. Meanwhile, Andrew was scrambling like a madman, trying to find a new used car to purchase so he wouldn’t have to transport Charlene around on his bike.</p>
					<p>When Charlene arrived, she got familiar with UCI, learned what this “ultimate frisbee” sport was, tasted real ramen, got acquainted with anime, and even dropped Andrew to class some days.</p>

					<p>Charlene packed her bags and moved to sunny California, trading snowstorms for traffic. They continued with new adventures, new learnings, and new self discoveries in the following years.</p>

					<p>Charlene spontaneously booked a weekend getaway to Cabo, Mexico. Andrew was inattentive and disinterested with the planning, so Charlene assumed everything would go according to her schedule.</p>
					<p>Unbeknownst to her, Andrew had his own sneaky agenda. He expressed a great deal of knowledge of Cabo’s points of interest when they arrived, leaving Charlene surprised and baffled. One evening, Andrew whisked Charlene to a very romantic restaurant, tucked into the cliffs, overlooking the Pacific Ocean. They sat there for three hours and caught the sun set at 8:07PM (that’s right, Andrew announced to Charlene the exact time for sunset). Upon leaving the restaurant, they approached a well lit tree, decorated with colorful heart ornaments (Andrew took no part in this, but it worked in his favor). It was here that Andrew dropped down on one knee, asking for Charlene’s hand. She was left speechless, caught in a surreal moment. She finally managed to say, “Yes…?” Andrew was thoroughly pleased with how things turned out.</p>
